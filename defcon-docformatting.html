		<h2>DEF CON 101: The Panel</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Mike Petruzzi (wiseacre), Senior Cyber Security Penetration Tester</p>
		<p class="speaker">Nikita Kronenberg, Not a Security Researcher, DEF CON</p>
		<p class="speaker">PushPin</p>
		<p class="speaker">Plug</p>
		<p class="speaker">Russ Rogers, Chief of Operations, DEF CON</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">DEF CON has changed for the better since the days at the Alexis Park.&nbsp; It has evolved from a few speaking tracks to an event that still offers the speakers, but also Villages, where you can get hands-on experience and Demo Labs where you can see tools in action. Of course, there is still the entertainment and Contest Area, as well as, Capture The Flag.&nbsp; There is so much more to DEF CON than there was in the past and it is our goal to help you get the best experience possible. In addition to introducing each of the different aspects and areas of DEF CON, we have a panel of speakers that will talk about how they came to be part of DEF CON and their personal experiences over the years.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Mike Petruzzi has been hacking managers for over 25 years. Mike is a Senior Cyber Security Penetration Testing Specialist working at various Federal Civil Agencies for the last 15 years. Yup, that's the title he was given. Naturally, he got all his IT experience as the result of selling beer, wine and liquor. He has tricked everyone into believing that he can do anything at all.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Nikita works full time for DEF CON doing stuff, and things. She is DEF CON's administrator, director of the CFP review board, speaker liaison, workshop manager, and overall cat herder. Helping out over the past decade she has been involved in some capacity for over a dozen departments, activities, contests, and events. She provides annoyance, planning, and support in many ways, thus dubbed the "administrator of chaos". If you hate the schedule, or are mad your talk was rejected, you can blame her. Nikita likes to think of herself as approachable, and loves to make people feel welcome at DEF CON, despite having R.B.F. Her hardest job yet was writing a serious third person bio.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">PushPin is an uptight, perfectionist, who is very rarely content working with idiots and enjoys his Jell-O Pudding cups. He can neither confirm nor deny working for any of the three letter agencies that oversee WMDs, high energy weapons [LASERS, YO], and play around with other countries. It is literally impossible to see him without his laptop at any given time during the day and has been told frequently to put it away in public; otherwise, you'll find him at work devoid of any form of social life. I hate you all, seriously..</p>

		<p class="speakerBio">Plug is a Mexican immigrant that immigrated to the States at age 18. While learning to read English found a 2600 magazine that lead him to his first LA2600 meeting in 1998, from that point forward he has been a computer security enthusiast. Over the years he has worked a System's Administrator with a focus in security, eventually moving full time to work in information security. Plug currently works as a Senior Security Engineer securing the network of a prominent finance and foreign exchange company. He is also working on a volunteer project to teach 5th graders basic computer security skills. In his free time he enjoys playing with synthesizers and modular systems, when possible he volunteers his time to computer security events.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">This is Russ' 17th year as a DEF CON goon, and he has over 25 years experience in hacking. Russ first learned to program around the 1982 timeframe, when he received a Timex Sinclair, which used only programs keyed in via BASIC. He's been involved in a numbers of aspects of DEF CON over the years, including the vendors, contests, DEF CON Groups, security, Hardware Hacking Village, and planning. Russ currently works a the Chief of Operations, where he depends heavily upon the other experienced hackers and goons that help run the world's largest hacker conference.</p>

		<h2>When the Secretary of State says: "Please Stop Hacking Us..."</h2>
		<p class="speaker">David An, Former U.S. State Department</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Senior American officials routinely hold dialogues with foreign officials to discuss cyber espionage. However, if a cyber attack can be performed through proxy servers jumping several countries before reaching the U.S., then can anyone ever be sure of who is really behind the attack? Yet we often see newspaper headlines clearly identifying that one country is hacking another country through state-sponsored, cyber criminal, or hacktivist means. Even if government cyber analysts with TS/SCI security clearances have high confidence in the identity of an attacker based on forensics and human intelligence, what are the challenges in effectively addressing the topic in a diplomatic or military dialogue with the attacker country?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Two major roadblocks in cyber diplomacy are the "attribution problem," and the related "disclosure dilemma." If there is indeed an attribution problem--when a country cannot be sure which other state is hacking it because a third country could be using it as a proxy--then a country could never accuse another countries of state-sponsored cyber attacks. Yet, countries routinely accuse others of cyber attacks, the public sees this in newspapers almost every day, and it is often an important topic in bilateral dialogues. Furthermore, the disclosure dilemma occurs when a country has both incentives and disincentives to disclose details on how it was hacked. On one hand, evidence will prove its case, but on another hand, evidence will make the attacker more savvy and careful not to repeat the same mistakes next time. Disclosure could create a stronger adversary. These are major concerns in the practice of cyber diplomacy today.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">My presentation identifies how government-to-government cyber diplomacy works, examines the attribution problem and disclosure dilemma more fully, and shows how the U.S. approaches this topic differently with partners versus potential adversaries. This is not a technical presentation, but rather it is a policy presentation on cyber diplomacy drawing from political science and my diplomatic experience.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">David was a tenured U.S. diplomat before leaving the U.S. government to consult for the private sector, and to write policy and academic papers. At the State Department, he was the senior political-military affairs officer covering the East Asia region and his responsibilities included coordinating diplomatic dialogues, formulating plans with the Pentagon, notifying Congress of U.S. arms sales, writing the Secretary of State's talking points, and traveling overseas with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense for bilateral dialogues. His other assignments included the U.S. embassies in Beijing, Tokyo, Wellington; U.S. consulates in Sydney and Perth; American Institute in Taiwan; and U.S. Pacific Command. He completed his B.A. at UC Berkeley; M.A. in international affairs and business management, and political science Ph.D. courses at UC San Diego.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Obligatory disclaimer: The comments are his own, and do not represent the U.S. government. Since Jeff Moss famously said in 2013: "Feds, we need some time apart," David emphasizes that he is no longer a fed.</p>

		<h2>Abusing XSLT for Practical Attacks</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Fernando Arnaboldi, Senior Security Consultant at IOActive </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Over the years, XML has been a rich target for attackers due to flaws in its design as well as implementations. It is a tempting target because it is used by other programming languages to interconnect applications and is supported by web browsers. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to use XSLT to produce documents that are vulnerable to new exploits.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">XSLT can be leveraged to affect the integrity of arithmetic operations, lead to code logic failure, or cause random values to use the same initialization vector. Error disclosure has always provided valuable information, but thanks to XSLT, it is possible to partially read system files that could disclose service or system's passwords. Finally, XSLT can be used to compromise end-user confidentiality by abusing the same-origin policy concept present in web browsers.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This presentation includes proof-of-concept attacks demonstrating XSLT's potential to affect production systems, along with recommendations for safe development.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Fernando Arnaboldi is a senior security researcher and consultant at IOActive, Inc. He has over 10 years of experience in the security research space (Deloitte, Core Security Technologies and IOActive) and holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>

		<h2>RFIDiggity: Pentester Guide to Hacking HF/NFC and UHF RFID</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Francis Brown, Partner - Bishop Fox </p>
		<p class="speaker">Shubham Shah , Security Analyst at Bishop Fox </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Have you ever attended an RFID hacking presentation and walked away with more questions than answers? This talk will finally provide practical guidance for penetration testers on hacking High Frequency (HF - 13.56 MHz) and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF - 840-960 MHz). This includes Near Field Communication (NFC), which also operates at 13.56 MHz and can be found in things like mobile payment technologies, e.g., Apple Pay and Google Wallet. We'll also be releasing a slew of new and free RFID hacking tools using Arduino microcontrollers, Raspberry Pis, phone/tablet apps, and even 3D printing.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This presentation will NOT weigh you down with theoretical details or discussions of radio frequencies and modulation schemes. It WILL serve as a practical guide for penetration testers to better understand the attack tools and techniques available to them for stealing and using RFID tag information, specifically for HF and UHF systems. We will showcase the best-of-breed in hardware and software that you'll need to build an RFID penetration toolkit. Our goal is to eliminate pervasive myths and accurately illustrate RFID risks via live attack DEMOS:</p>

		<ul class="talkList">
		<li>High Frequency / NFC - Attack Demos:
		<ul class="talkList">
		<li>HF physical access control systems (e.g., iCLASS and MIFARE DESFire 'contactless smart card' product families)
		</li><li>Credit cards, public transit cards, passports (book), mobile payment systems (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Wallet), NFC loyalty cards (e.g., MyCoke Rewards), new hotel room keys, smart home door locks, and more
		</li></ul>
		</li><li>Ultra-High Frequency - Attack Demos:
		<ul class="talkList">
		<li>Ski passes, enhanced driver's licenses, passports (card), U.S. Permanent Resident Card ('green card'), trusted traveler cards
		</li></ul>
		</li></ul>

		<p class="abstract">Schematics and Arduino code will be released, and 100 lucky audience members will receive one of a handful of new flavors of our Tastic RFID Thief custom PCB, which they can insert into almost any commercial RFID reader to steal badge info or use as a MITM backdoor device capable of card replay attacks. New versions include extended control capabilities via Arduino add-on modules such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and GSM/GPRS (SMS messaging) modules.</p>

<h2>Guests N' Goblins: Exposing Wi-Fi Exfiltration Risks and Mitigation techniques</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Peter Desfigies, Cyber Security Investigations Unit, TELUS Security Solutions</p>
		<p class="speaker">Joshua Brierton, Sr. Security Analyst, TELUS Communications</p>
		<p class="speaker">Naveed Ul Islam, Managing Consultant, TELUS</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Wi-Fi is a pervasive part of everyone's everyday life. Whether it be home networks, open hotspots at cafes, corporate networks or corporate guest networks they can be found virtually everywhere. Fortunately, for the security minded, some steps are taken to secure these weak points in one's infrastructure. Usually this is done through some form of registration page which is common in the case of guest networks. But is this enough? And what new threats could be unleashed from even the most isolated of Wi-Fi networks?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In the most paranoid of cases, companies will generally attempt to isolate Wi-Fi networks from their official networks in order to protect their own assets from attacks, while still ensuring that Wi-Fi is convenient for end users. But there is another way to attack a company that could be damaging to the host company and harmful to other targets. This presentation will go over the utilization of various techniques of getting onto and getting out through publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks for nefarious purposes, termed Wi-Fi Exfiltration. Through this technique one is able to obfuscate their identity by using the host of the Wi-Fi's identity, thus implicating the host in the attack.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">During the presentation we will cover the findings through our tests along with a list of recommendations for what can be done to mitigate this risk. This is a must attend session to all security professionals and high level management.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Peter Desfigies is a Security Consultant at TELUS Communications Inc. where he works with a team of other operations analysts to proactively investigate and analyze customer traffic, while also providing threat intelligence on attacks, campaigns, and zero-days in order to protect customer's environment and enhance their security posture.

		<h2>Crypto for Hackers</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Eijah, Founder, Demonsaw</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Hacking is hard. It takes passion, dedication, and an unwavering attention to detail. Hacking requires a breadth of knowledge spread across many domains. We need to have experience with different platforms, operating systems, software packages, tools, programming languages, and technology trends. Being overly deficient in any one of these areas can add hours to our hack, or even worse, bring us total failure.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">And while all of these things are important for a well-rounded hacker, one of the key areas that is often overlooked is cryptography. In an era dominated by security breaches, an understanding of encryption and hashing algorithms provides a tremendous advantage. We can better hone our attack vectors, especially when looking for security holes. A few years ago I released the first Blu-Ray device key, AA856A1BA814AB99FFDEBA6AEFBE1C04, by exploiting a vulnerability in an implementation of the AACS protocol. As hacks go, it was a simple one. But it was the knowledge of crypto that made it all possible.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This presentation is an overview of the most common crypto routines helpful to hackers. We'll review the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, which ones to embrace, and which ones to avoid. You'll get C++ code examples, high-level wrapper classes, and an open-source library that implements all the algorithms. We'll even talk about creative ways to merge algorithms to further increase entropy and key strength. If you've ever wanted to learn how crypto can give you an advantage as a hacker, then this talk is for you. With this information you'll be able to maximize your hacks and better protect your personal data.</p>

		<h2>Extending Fuzzing Grammars to Exploit Unexplored Code Paths in Modern Web Browsers</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Saif El-Sherei, Analyst, SensePost </p>
		<p class="speaker">Etienne Stalmans, Analyst, SensePost </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Fuzzing is a well-established technique for finding bugs, hopefully exploitable ones, by brute forcing inputs to explore code paths in an application. In recent years, fuzzing has become a near mandatory part of any major application's security team efforts. Our work focused on fuzzing web browsers, a particularly difficult challenge given the size and quality of some of their security teams, the existing high-quality fuzzers available for this, and, of late, bug bounty programs.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Despite this, our improved fuzzing approach was able to find four confirmed bugs within Google Chrome and two within Microsoft Internet Explorer 11. The bugs had varying potential exploitability. Interestingly, some had been independently discovered indicating others are active in this field. The work is on going, and we hope to have more before the presentation.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">As browsers continue to grow as the new universal interface for devices and applications, they have become high value targets for exploitation. Additionally, with the growth of browser fuzzing since 2004, this is a complex field to get started in. Something we hope to help address.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Our research and presentation will consist of two parts:</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The first part is an introduction to fuzzing for the security practitioner. Here we combine the approaches, tool sets and integrations between tools we found to be most effective into a recipe for fuzzing various browsers and various platforms.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The second part is a description of our work and approach used to create, and extend, browser fuzzing grammars based on w3c specifications to discover new and unexplored code paths, and find new browser security bugs. In particular, example of real bugs found in the Chrome and IE browser will be demonstrated.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Saif is the body double for Borat, but couldn't pull off a mankini and ended up in information security. His focus is on fuzzing and vulnerability research.</p>

<h2>Secure Messaging for Normal People</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Justin Engler, Senior Security Engineer, iSEC Partners</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">"Secure" messaging programs and protocols continue to proliferate, and crypto experts can debate their minutiae, but there is very little information available to help the rest of the world differentiate between the different programs and their features. This talk will discuss the types of attacks various secure messaging features can defend against so those who are tech-savvy but not crypto-experts can make informed decisions on which crypto applications to use.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This talk is intended for people with no preexisting cryptography knowledge. There will be no math or programming knowledge required. The goal is to explain secure messaging concepts such as PKI, PFS, and key validation without diving into heavier crypto, math, or programming content.</p>

		<h2>Linux Containers: Future or Fantasy?</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Aaron Grattafiori, Principal Security Consultant, iSEC Partners/NCC Group </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Containers, a pinnacle of fast and secure deployment or a panacea of false security? In recent years Linux containers have developed from an insecure and loose collection of Linux kernel namespaces to a production-ready OS virtualization stack. In this talk, the audience will first learn the basics of how containers function, understanding namespaces, capabilities and cgroups in order to see how Linux containers and the supporting kernel features can offer an effective application and system sandboxing solution yet to be widely deployed or adopted. Understanding LXC or Docker use, weaknesses and security for PaaS and application sandboxing is only the beginning.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Leveraging container technologies is rapidly becoming popular within the modern PaaS and devops world but little has been publicly discussed in terms of actual security risks or guarantees. Understanding prior container vulnerabilities or escapes, and current risks or pitfalls in major public platforms will be explored in this talk. I'll cover methods to harden containers against future attacks and common mistakes to avoid when using systems such as LXC and Docker. This will also include an analysis and discussion of techniques such as Linux kernel hardening, reduced capabilities, Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), the User kernel namespace and seccomp-bpf (syscall filtering); all of which help actually contain containers. The talk will end on some methods for creating minimal, highly-secure containers and end on where containers are going and why they might show up where you least expect them.</p>

		<h2>Are We Really Safe? - Bypassing Access Control Systems</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Dennis Maldonado, Security Consultant - KLC Consulting </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Access control systems are everywhere. They are used to protect everything from residential communities to commercial offices. People depend on these to work properly, but what if I had complete control over your access control solution just by using my phone? Or perhaps I input a secret keypad combination that unlocks your front door? You may not be as secure as you think.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The world relies on access control systems to ensure that secured areas are only accessible to authorized users. Usually, a keypad is the only thing stopping an unauthorized person from accessing the private space behind it. There are many types of access control systems from stand-alone keypads to telephony access control. In this talk, Dennis will be going over how and where access control systems are used. Dennis will walk through and demonstrate the tips and tricks used in bypassing common access control systems. This presentation will include attack methods of all nature including physical attacks, RFID, wireless, telephony, network, and more.</p>

		<h2>Sorry, Wrong Number: Mysteries Of The Phone System - Past and Present</h2>
		<p class="speaker">"Unregistered436" Patrick McNeil, Security Architect</p>
		<p class="speaker">"Snide" Owen, Security Researcher</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Exploring the phone system was once the new and exciting realm of "phone phreaks," an ancestor of today's computer "hackers." The first phreaks "owned" and explored the vague mysteries of the telephone network for a time until their activities drew too much attention from the phone companies and law enforcement. The phone system evolved, somewhat, in an attempt to shut them out, and phreaking became both difficult and legally dangerous. Such events paralleled a new personal computer "revolution" wherein phone phreaks made the transition from the secret subtleties of telephony to the new and mystical frontier of personal computing. Private BBS(s) and, eventually, the Internet was not only the next logical step forward, but also provided "safer" alternatives that still allowed for the thrill of exploring the mysteries of a new modern age. Telephony, and voice security in general, became, as the years passed, something of a lost art to all but those who remember...</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this presentation we begin our adventure with a journey back in time, starting in the post-war Film Noir era of the 40's and 50's, when users required an operator at the switchboard to make a call, investigating some of the early roots of phreaking that many have forgotten. We will briefly take a look at the weaknesses of early telephone systems and the emergence of the original phreaks in the 50's and 60's who found and exploited them. Our journey will also allow us to demonstrate how some of the same basic phreaking approaches are still applicable to today's "advanced" VoIP systems.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Certainly the initial creation and emergence of VoIP opened a variety of attack vectors that were covered at security conferences at the time. Commercial VoIP adoption, however, remained stagnant until standards and carriers caught up. Some VoIP hacking tools were left unmaintained, and VoIP wasn't the sexy and mysterious attack vector it once was with the exception of tricksters who found old or insecure systems to be easy targets. Due to increased VoIP adoption over the last few years, however, telephony attacks are provocative once again.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">As hardboiled VoIP detectives, we'll unravel the mysteries of the curious, shadowy, and secretive world of phreaks, tricksters, and VoIP hackers. We'll compare and contrast old school phreaking with new advances in VoIP hacking. We'll explain how voice systems are targeted, how they are attacked using old and new methods, and how to secure them - with demonstrations along with practical and actionable tips along the way. We may even drop a new VoIP telephony phishing tool to fuse the past and the present..</p>

		<h2>A Hacker's Guide to Risk</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Bruce Potter, The Shmoo Group</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">When the latest and greatest vulnerability is announced, the media and PR frenzy can be dizzying. However, when the dust settles, how do we actually measure the risk represented by a given vulnerability. When pen testers find holes in an organization, is it really "ZOMG, you're SO 0WNED!" or is it something more manageable and controlled? When you're attempting to convince the boss of the necessity of the latest security technology, how do really rank the importance of the technology against the threats facing the organization.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Understanding risk can be tricky, especially in an industry that often works on gut feelings and values quantity over quality. But risk and risk management doesn't need to be complicated. With a few basic formulas and access to some simple models, understanding risk can be a straightforward process. This talk will discuss risk, why its important, and the poor job the hacker community has done when it comes to properly assessing risk. It will also touch on some existing risk assessment and management systems, as well as provide worked examples of real world vulnerabilities and systems and the risks they pose. Finally, this talk will examine some practical guidance on how you, as hackers, security researchers, and security practitioners can better measure risk in your day to day life</p>

Bruce has been in the computer security field for nearly 2 decades which means he is getting old and increasingly jaded. His primary focus areas are trusted computing, cyber security risk management (yikes!), and large scale vulnerability analysis. Bruce believes that while attackers have the upper hand, we can still do better with the tools we have than most people realize.

<h2>Applied Intelligence: Using Information That's Not There</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Michael Schrenk, Security Researcher </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Organizations continue to unknowingly leak trade secrets on the Internet. To those in the know, these leaks are a valuable source of competitive intelligence. This talk describes how the speaker collects competitive intelligence for his own online retail business. Specifically, you learn how he combines, trends, and analyzes information within specific contexts to manufacture useful data that is real, but technically doesn't exist on it's own. For example, you will learn about the trade secrets that are hidden within sequential numbers, how he uses collected intelligence to procure inventory, and how and why he gauges the ongoing health of his industry and that of his competitors. And on a related note, you'll also learn how the federal government nearly exposed an entire generation to identity fraud.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Michael Schrenk has presented six DEF CON talks on intelligence and organizational privacy, including last year's talk "You're Leaking Trade Secrets". He has developed Internet-based intelligence campaigns since 1995 for organizations as diverse as: Fortune 500 Companies, Private Investigators, Asian Art Dealers, and Investigative Journalists. His adventures in intelligence have taken him around the world, with speaking opportunities in The Middle East, Eastern Europe, The UK, Silicon Valley, and most places in between. Mike is also the author of "Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers (2007 &amp; 2012, No Starch Press, San Francisco)".

		<h2>I Am Packer And So Can You</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Mike Sconzo, Security Researcher </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Automating packer and compiler/toolchain detection can be tricky and best and downright frustrating at worst. The majority of existing solutions are old, closed source or aren't cross platform. Originally, a method of packer identification that leveraged some text analysis algorithms was presented. The goal is to create a method to identify compilers and packers based on the structural changes they leave behind in PE files. This iteration builds upon previous work of using assembly mnemonics for packer detection and grouping. New features and analysis are covered for identification and clustering of PE files.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Mike Sconzo has been around the Security Industry for quite some time, and is interested in creating and implementing new methods of detecting unknown and suspicious network activity as well as different approaches for file/malware analysis. This includes looking for protocol anomalies, patterns of network traffic, and various forms of static and dynamic file analysis. He works on reversing malware, tool creation for analysis, and threat intelligence. Currently a lot of his time is spent doing data exploration and tinkering with statistical analysis and machine learning.</p>


<h2>NSM 101 for ICS</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Chris Sistrunk, Sr. ICS Security Consultant, FireEye </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Is your ICS breached? Are you sure? How do you know?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The current state of security in Industrial Control Systems is a widely publicized issue, but fixes to ICS security issues are long cycle, with some systems and devices that will unfortunately never have patches available. In this environment, visibility into security threats to ICS is critical, and almost all of ICS monitoring has been focused on compliance, rather than looking for indicators/evidence of compromise. The non-intrusive nature of Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is a perfect fit for ICS. This presentation will show how NSM should be part of ICS defense and response strategy, various options for implementing NSM, and some of the capabilities that NSM can bring to an ICS security program. Free tools such as Security Onion, Snort IDS, Bro IDS, NetworkMiner, and Wireshark will be used to look at the ICS environment for anomalies. It will be helpful if attendees have read these books (but they aren't required): The Cuckoo's Egg by Cliff Stoll, The Practice of Network Security Monitoring by Richard Bejtlich, and Applied Network Security Monitoring by Chris Sanders and Jason Smith.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Chris Sistrunk is a Senior Consultant at Mandiant, focusing on cyber security for industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure.

		<h2>Beyond the Scan: The Value Proposition of Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Damon Small, Security Researcher</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Vulnerability Assessment is, by some, regarded as one of the least "sexy" capabilities in information security. However, it is the presenter's view that it is also a key component of any successful infosec program, and one that is often overlooked. Doing so serves an injustice to the organization and results in many missed opportunities to help ensure success in protecting critical information assets. The presenter will explore how Vulnerability Assessment can be leveraged "Beyond the Scan" and provide tangible value to not only the security team, but the entire business that it supports.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Damon Small began his career studying music at Louisiana State University. Pursuing his desire to actually make money, he took advantage of computer skills learned in the LSU recording studio to become a systems administrator in the mid 1990s.

		<h2>The Bieber Project: Ad Tech 101, Fake Fans and Adventures in Buying Internet Traffic</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Mark Ryan Talabis, Chief Security Scientist, zVelo </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In the past year, I found myself immersed in the multi-billion dollar digital advertising industry. This gave me the opportunity to investigate the unique security challenges and issues facing the industry. It was a shock to me at first how complex the advertising ecosystem was particularly in the advent of programmatic advertising. But I dove in head first and learned a lot which I would like to share with my fellow security professionals. During this time, I got involved with unscrupulous publishers, apathetic ad networks, angry advertisers and activist malware researchers. I encountered self proclaimed experts with fantastic claims, vendors using scare tactics, and a glaring disconnect between the security and ad tech worlds.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this presentation, I would like to be able to provide the audience with my experience plus a number of things. Among which are:</p>

		<ul class="talkList">
		<li>Provide security professionals a 101 type of introduction to the world of digital advertising ecosystem. Among the things we will tackle is what is programmatic advertising, what the roles are of the different players like ad networks are and how money is made off all this interplay. 

		</li><li>Provide the audience a perspective on what security challenges the advertising industry is facing and opportunities for us security professionals to be involved. We all know about malvertising and its a big deal to us security guys but there are bigger, and in an advertisers perspective, more relevant issues that needs to be taken care of first. All of this will be discussed in this talk. 

		</li><li>An introduction about the different and creative ways unscrupulous publishers can pad their earnings. We will be talking about hidden ads, ad stacking, intrusive ads, auto-refreshes, popups, popunders, blackhat SEO techniques and dirty inventory. 

		</li><li>An in depth discussion on the problems caused by non-human traffic (NHT). We will talk about what it is, why is it a problem, how it is generated, and more importantly, how do we catch it? In fact, this presentation is named the "Bieber Project" which is the experiment which I leveraged to understand non-human traffic and determine how we can identify it.

<h2>Hackers Hiring Hackers - How to Do Things Better</h2>

		<p class="speaker">IrishMASMS, Hacker</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">There are a lot of talks about how to be a better pen tester and workshops that show you how to use all of the cool new tools that are available to make our jobs easier, but there are only a few talks that address what some of us consider to be the hardest part of getting a job in security: the hiring process. The information security field is in desperate need of people with the technical skills hackers have to fill a myriad of roles within organizations across the world. However, both sides of the table are doing horribly when it comes to hiring and interviewing for work.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Organizations are doing poorly trying to communicate expectations for a job, there are people going to interviews without knowing how to showcase their (limited or vast) experience, and some people posture themselves so poorly that the hiring managers don't think the candidates are really interested in the job. This talk takes the experiences of the speakers as both interviewers and interviewees as well as from others within the scene in order to help better prepare hackers to enter (or move within) "the industry" as well as let the people making hiring decisions know what they can do to get the people and experience they need for their teams.</p>

<h2>And That's How I Lost My Other Eye: Further Explorations In Data Destruction</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Zoz, Robotics Engineer and Security Researcher</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">How much more paranoid are you now than you were four years ago? Warrantless surveillance and large-scale data confiscation have brought fear of the feds filching your files from black helicopter territory into the mainstream. Recent government snatch-and-grabs have run the gamut from remotely imaging foreign servers to straight up domestic coffeeshop muggings, so if you think you might need to discard a lot of data in hurry you're probably right. In their legendary DEF CON 19 presentation Shane Lawson, Bruce Potter and Deviant Ollam kicked off the discussion, and now it's time for another installment. While purging incriminating material residing on spinning disks remains the focus, the research has been expanded to encompass solid state storage and mobile solutions to your terabyte trashing needs. With best efforts to comply with the original constraints, the 2015 update features more analysis of the efficacy of kinetic projectiles, energetic materials and high voltages for saving your freedom at the potential cost of only a redundant body part... or two.</p>

		<h2>Malware in the Gaming Micro-economy</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Zack Allen, Lead Research Engineer, ZeroFOX</p>
		<p class="speaker">Rusty Bower, Information Security Engineer</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Microeconomics focuses on how patterns of supply and demand determine price and output in individual markets [1]. Within recent years, micro-economies have flourished within the video game industry. Companies like Valve rely heavily on a business model that depends on gamers making purchases for in-game items. Players can trade these items in bulk for a rare item, make bets on a competitive gaming match or gift the item for a charity event.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">While originally well-intentioned, creating these micro-economies also created an incentive for criminals to scam and even steal from unsuspecting victims. Traditional scams date as far back to games like Diablo or Runescape where players were duped in trade windows and in game messaging systems were used to steal items. These low-tech strategies are effective, but recently a new, high-tech scam strategy has emerged relying upon malware specifically targeting the Steam micro-economy.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Over the last year, we have collected and reversed dozens of samples of malware that target Steam users. Pieces of malware can be sophisticated RAM scrapers that pilfer an item in memory and send trade requests through the Steam trading API, or as simple as a remote login service. The end result is the same - the hacker loots the victim's backpack of in game items to sell them on the market for profit. This talk focuses on the techniques we have found in these samples, surveys of victims of these scams and the distribution of money lost from them (up to the $1000s of dollars for users in some cases) and the defenses Steam has put in place to combat this hacker underground.</p>

		<h2>How to secure the keyboard chain</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Paul Amicelli, Student from IT Engineering School -&nbsp;ESIEA in Laval, France</p>
		<p class="speaker">Baptiste David, Engineer from IT Engineer School - ESIEA in Laval, France</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Keyloggers are hardware or software tools that record keystrokes. They are an overlooked threat to the computer security and user's privacy. As they are able to retrieve all sensitive information typed on a keyboard in an almost invisibly way , they need to be seriously considered both for companies and individuals. Almost all the security measures against keyloggers are post-active and static.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">*So what if the solution were to be proactive, and use the same technology as keyloggers do, in order to fool them ? This is all about this presentation, a way of fooling all known and unknown keyloggers (physicals, kernel-mode and user-mode) through a kernel mode driver developed under Windows. The technical details will be presented during the presentation, as well as the results and propositions.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Basically, the idea is to use a kernel mode driver which encrypts each keyboard key hit, at a very low level in the system (near the driver port). The encryption is made according to a common key, exchanged with a client application which needs to ensure that the entered text is secured and not recorded. After the driver has encrypted a key, it spreads it to the entire system. Thus, only the client application, holding the encryption key, can decrypt the keyboard key. In this way, the whole system is fooled.</p>

Topics will include how to (legally) get hold of and test a real world device, and how to use cheap software defined radios to spoof GSM cell towers. Focus will be on the details of how one particular device is constructed, how it operates and the vulnerabilities it was found to contain. How these vulnerabilities can be exploited and the challenges of doing so in the wild will also be covered.</p>

<h2>Quantum Computers vs. Computers Security</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Principal Cryptographer, Kudelski Security, Switzerland</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">We've heard about hypothetical quantum computers breaking most of the public-key crypto in use-RSA, elliptic curves, etc.-and we've heard about "post-quantum" systems that resist quantum computers. We also heard about quantum computers' potential to solve other problems considerably faster than classical computers, such as discrete optimization, machine learning, or code verification problems. And we heard about a commercial quantum computer, and we heard vendors of quantum key distribution or quantum random number generators promise us security as solid as the laws of physics. Still, most of us are clueless regarding:</p>

		<ul class="talkList">
		<li> How quantum computers work and why they could solve certain problems
		faster than classical computers?
		</li><li> What are the actual facts and what is FUD, hype, or journalistic
		exaggeration?
		</li><li> Could quantum computers help in defending classical computers and
		networks against intrusions?
		</li><li> Is it worth spending money in post-quantum systems, quantum key
		distribution, or in purchasing or developing of a quantum computer? 
		</li><li> Will usable quantum computers be built in the foreseeable future?
		</li></ul>

		<p class="abstract">This talk gives honest answers to those questions, based on the latest research, on analyses of the researchers' and vendors' claims, and on a cost-benefit-risk analyses. We'll expose the fundamental principles of quantum computing in a way comprehensible by anyone, and we'll skip the technical details that require math and physics knowledge. Yet after this talk you'll best be able to assess the risk of quantum computers, to debunk misleading claims, and to ask the right questions.</p>

		<p class="abstract">Key-Loggers are cool, really cool. It seems, however, that every conceivable aspect of key-logging has already been covered: from physical devices to hooking techniques. What possible innovation could be left in this field?</p>
		<br>
		<p>Well, that's what we used to think too. That is until we noticed that little grey box sitting there underneath a monitor, next to yesterday's dirty coffee cup. The little grey box that is most commonly known as 'KVM'.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The talk will tell the tale of our long journey to transform an innocent KVM into a raging key-logging monster. We will safely guide you through the embedded wastelands, past unknown IC's, to explore uncharted serial protocols and unravel monstrous obfuscation techniques.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Walking along the misty firmware woods of 8051 assembly we will challenge ambiguous functions and confront undebuggable environments.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Finally, we will present a live demo of our POC code and show you that air-gapped networks might not be as segregated as you imagined.</p>
		<br>
		<p>You will witness that malware code could actually reside outside your computer, persisting through reboots, wipes, formats, and even hardware replacements. You might laugh, you might cry, but one thing is certain - you will never look at your KVM the same as before.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The security of SSL/TLS is built on a rickety scaffolding of trust. At the core of this system is an ever growing number of Certificate Authorities that most people (and software) take for granted. Recent attacks have exploited this inherent trust to covertly intercept, monitor and manipulate supposedly secure communications. These types of attack endanger everyone, especially when they remain undetected. Unfortunately, there are few tools that non-technical humans can use to verify that their HTTPS traffic is actually secure.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">We will present our research into the technical and political problems underlying SSL/TLS. We will also demonstrate a tool, currently called "Canary", that will allow all types users to validate the digital certificates presented by services on the Internet.</p>

		<h2>Exploring Layer 2 Network Security in Virtualized Environments</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Ronny L. Bull, Ph.D. Graduate Student, Clarkson University</p>
		<p class="speaker">Jeanna N. Matthews, Associate Professor, Clarkson University</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Cloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. In this paper, we explore whether Layer 2 network attacks that work on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts by performing a systematic study across four major hypervisor environments - Open vSwitch, Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V Server and VMware vSphere - in seven different virtual networking configurations. First, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a MAC flooding attack and evaluate the impact on co-resident VMs. We find that network performance is degraded on all platforms and that it is possible to eavesdrop on other client traffic passing over the same virtual network for Open vSwitch and Citrix XenServer. Second, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a rogue DHCP server and then run multiple DHCP attack scenarios. On all four platforms, co-resident VMs can be manipulated by providing them with incorrect or malicious network information.</p>

		<p class="speakerBio">Mr. Bull is a Computer Science Ph.D. graduate student at Clarkson University focusing on Layer 2 network security in virtualized environments. He presented his preliminary research involving MAC flooding attacks against virtualized networks at the DerbyCon 4.0 computer security conference held in Louisville, KY in September 2014. Mr. Bull earned an A.A.S. degree in Computer Networking at Herkimer College in 2006 and completed both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at the State University of New York Institute of Technology in 2011.

		<p class="abstract">This talk will introduce you to Industrial Ethernet Switches and their vulnerabilities. These are switches used in industrial environments, like substations, factories, refineries, ports, or other homes of industrial automation. In other words: DCS, PCS, ICS &amp; SCADA switches.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The researchers focus on attacking the management plane of these switches, because we all know that industrial system protocols lack authentication or cryptographic integrity. Thus, compromising any switch allows the creation of malicious firmwares for further MITM manipulation of a live process. Such MITM manipulation can lead to the plant or process shutting down (think: nuclear reactor SCRAM) or getting into a unknown and hazardous state (think: damaging a blast furnace at a steel mill)</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Not only will vulnerabilities be disclosed for the first time, but the methods of finding those vulnerabilities will be shared. All vulnerabilities disclosed will be in the default configuration state of the devices. While these vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors, SCADA/ICS patching in live environments tends to take 1-3 years. Because of this patching lag, the researchers will also be providing live mitigations that owner/operators can use immediately to protect themselves. At least four vendors switches will be examined: Siemens, GE, Garrettcom and Opengear.</p>

Welcome to "brainwallets", a way for truly paranoid cryptocurrency users to wager their fortunes on their ability to choose a good password or passphrase.

		</p><p class="abstract">Over the last decade, we've seen the same story play out dozens of times - a website is broken into, the user database is posted online, and most of the password hashes are cracked. Computers are now able make millions, billions or even trillions of guesses per second. Every eight character password you can type on a standard keyboard and every combination of five common english words could be tried in less than a day by today's botnets. Can people come up with passphrases able to stand up to that when money is on the line? Let's find out.</p>

		<p class="abstract"><del>From the US to China and beyond, anonymity on the internet is under fire - particularly for whistleblowers. National interests are pushing for greater control and monitoring of internet content, often invoking harsh punishments for informers and journalists, if caught. While a range of technologies (such as ToR) can provide some level of anonymity, a fundamental flaw still exists: a direct relationship between IP address and physical location.

		<h2>Why nation-state malwares target Telco Networks: Dissecting technical capabilities -Regin and its counterparts</h2> 
		<p class="speaker">Omer Coskun, Ethical Hacker with KPN REDteam, KPN (Royal Dutch Telecom)</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The recent research in malware analysis suggests state actors allegedly use cyber espionage campaigns against GSM networks. Analysis of state-sponsored malwares such like Flame, Duqu, Uruborus and the Regin revealed that these were designed to sustain long-term intelligence-gathering operations by remaining under the radar. Antivirus companies made a great job in revealing technical details of the attack campaigns, however, it exclusively has almost focused on the executables or the memory dump of the infected systems - the research hasn't been simulated in a real environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">GSM networks still use ancient protocols; Signaling System 7 (SS7), GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which contain loads of vulnerable components. Malware authors totally aware of it and weaponing exploits within their campaigns to grab encrypted and unencrypted streams of private communications handled by the Telecom companies. For instance, Regin was developed as a framework that can be customized with a wide range of different capabilities, one of the most interesting ability to monitor GSM networks.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this talk, we are going to break down the Regin framework stages from a reverse engineering perspective - kernel driver infection scheme, virtual file system and its encryption scheme, kernel mode manager- while analyzing its behaviors on a GSM network and making technical comparison of its counterparts - such as TDL4, Uruborus, Duqu2.</p>

		<h2>Do Export Controls on "Intrusion Software" Threaten Vulnerability Research?</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Tom Cross aka Decius, CTO, Drawbridge Networks</p>
		<p class="speaker">Collin Anderson, Independent Researcher</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">At the end of 2013, an international export control regime known as the Wassenaar Arrangement was updated to include controls on technology related to "Intrusion Software" and "IP Network Surveillance Systems." Earlier this year, the US Government announced a draft interpretation of these new controls, which has kicked off a firestorm of controversy within the information security community. Questions abound regarding what the exact scope of the proposed rules is, and what impact the rules might have on security researchers. Is it now illegal to share exploit code across borders, or to disclose a vulnerability to a software vendor in another country? Can export controls really keep surveillance technology developed in the west out of the hands of repressive regimes? This presentation will provide a deep dive on the text of the new controls and discuss what they are meant to cover, how the US Government has indicated that it may interpret them, and what those interpretations potentially mean for computer security researchers, and for the Internet as a whole.</p>

		<p class="abstract">Regular Expression Denial of Service has existed for well over a decade, but has not received the love it deserves lately. There are some proof of concept attacks out there currently, most of which are ineffective due to implementation optimizations. Regardless of the effectiveness most of these PoC's are geared only to NFA engines.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This talk will demonstrate working PoC's that bypass optimizations. Both NFA and DFA engines will get love. Tools will be released (with demonstration) that benchmark NFA/DFA engines and automate creation of 'evil strings' given an arbitrary regular expression. Attendees can expect a review of regex and a deep under the hood explanation of both regex engines before abuses ensue.</p>

		<p class="abstract">Security research is under attack. Updates to the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 established among its 41 member nations an agreement to place a variety of previously undesignated "cybersecurity items" under export control. After 18 months and a half-dozen open advisory meetings, the U.S. has taken the entire security research community by surprise with its proposed rule; we are confronted by a sweeping implementation with profound consequences for academia, independent research, commercial cybersecurity, human rights, and national security.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">While the outcome of this round of regulatory intervention is still uncertain, the fact that there will be more is not. This panel of experts will discuss the context, history, and general process of regulation, as well the related question of "weaponized" research in regulatory discourse.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">There is significant daylight between the relatively lax text of the Wassenaar Arrangement itself and the extraordinarily broad implementation proposed in the U.S. What will the practical effects of those differences be, and why did the U.S. diverge from the Wassenaar text? Regulators are, even now, still struggling to comprehend what the consequences of this new "cyber rule" might be. So, how are we to understand this regulatory process? What are its objectives? Its impacts? Its limits? How can we influence its outcomes?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Eleventh-hour interventions are quickly becoming a hallmark of regulatory activities with implications for the wider world of information security; the fight here is almost exclusively a rearguard action. Without resorting to the usual polemics, what failures of analysis and advice are contributing to these missteps - on both sides? What interests might encourage them? How are security researchers being caught so off-balance? Come victory or despair in the present case, this panel aims to answer the question of whether there is a solution that prevents technology transfer to hostile nations while still enabling free markets, freedom of expression, and freedom of research.</p>

		<h2>Dark side of the ELF - leveraging dynamic loading to pwn noobs</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Alessandro Di Federico, PhD Student, Politecnico di Milano</p>
		<p class="speaker">Yan Shoshitaishvili, PhD Student, UC Santa Barbara</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The ELF format is ancient, and much mystery lurks in its dark depths. For 16 years, it has safely encompassed our software, providing support for binary loading, symbol resolution, and lots of very useful binary stuff. In that time, security has become a key concern, resulting in binary defenses like NX and ASLR, which have made exploiting vulnerabilities quite difficult. ASLR, for example, randomizes the location of the stack, the heap, libraries, and (optionally), the binary itself at every execution of an application.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">There is no easy way to say this: ELF has let us down. In this talk, we'll explore the dark side of ELF. Specifically, we'll show how ELF, by design, implicitly trusts data structures in the ELF headers. Even in the presence of ASLR, an attacker able to corrupt these headers can trick the ELF loader into calling any function in any linked-in library, providing nothing but the name of the binary. In essence, this technique allows an attacker to call arbitrary library functions (such as system()!) without leaking memory addresses. We call this technique Leakless.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">While developing Leakless, we checked many different implementations of the standard C library and found that Leakless can be adapted to attack the ELF loader implementations in all of the common ones (i.e., GNU libc, the libc of the major BSDs, and uClibc). In this talk, we'll describe the internals of the ELF format, show how Leakless works to subvert library function resolution, and demonstrate how it can be use to carry out attacks without information disclosures. And, of course, we'll open-source the tool that we developed to make carrying out this attack easier.</p>

When they begin snooping through your hard work, it pays to have planned out your defense ahead of time. You can take the traditional defensive route - encryption, obfuscation, anti-debugging - or you can go on the offense, and attack the heart and soul of anyone who dare look at your perfect code. With some carefully crafted assembly, we'll show how to break down a reverse engineer by sending them misleading, intimidating, and demoralizing messages through the control flow graphs of their favorite RE tools - turning their beloved IDA (Hopper, BinNavi, Radare, etc) into unwitting weapons for devastating psychological warfare in reverse engineering.</p>

		<p class="abstract">The term "Bad USB" has gotten some much needed press in last few months. There have been talks that have identified the risks that are caused by the inherent trust between the OS and any device attached by USB. I found in my research that most of the available payloads for the USB rubber ducky would be stopped by common enterprise security solutions. I then set out to create a new exploit that would force the victim to trust my Man-In-The-Middle access point. After my payload is deployed, all Wi-Fi communications will be readable, including usernames, passwords and authentication cookies. The attack will work without the need of elevating privileges, which makes it ideal for corporate environments.</p>

		<h2>BurpKit - Using WebKit to Own the Web</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Nadeem Douba, Founding Principal, Red Canari</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Today's web apps are developed using a mashup of client- and server-side technologies. Everything from sophisticated Javascript libraries to third-party web services are thrown into the mix. Over the years, we've been asked to test these web apps with security tools that haven't evolved at the same pace. A common short-coming in most of these tools is their inability to perform dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities such as dynamically rendered XSS or DOM-based XSS. This is where BurpKit comes in - a BurpSuite plugin that integrates the power of WebKit with that of BurpSuite. In this presentation we'll go over how one can leverage WebKit to write their own web pen-testing tools and introduce BurpKit. We'll show you how BurpKit is able to perform a variety of powerful tasks including dynamic analysis, BurpSuite scripting, and more! Best of all, the plugin will be free and open source so you can extended it to your heart's desire!

		<h2>Stagefright: Scary Code in the Heart of Android</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Joshua J. Drake, Sr. Director of Platform Research and Exploitation, Zimperium</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">With over a billion activated devices, Android holds strong as the market leading smartphone operating system. Underneath the hood, it is primarily built on the tens of gigabytes of source code from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Thoroughly reviewing a code base of this size is arduous at best -- arguably impossible. Several approaches exist to combat this problem. One such approach is identifying and focusing on a particularly dangerous area of code.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This presentation centers around the speaker's experience researching a particularly scary area of Android, the Stagefright multimedia framework. By limiting his focus to a relatively small area of code that's critically exposed on 95% of devices, Joshua discovered a multitude of implementation issues with impacts ranging from unassisted remote code execution down to simple denial of service. Apart from a full explanation of these vulnerabilities, this presentation also discusses; techniques used for discovery, Android OS internals, and the disclosure process. Finally, proof-of-concept code will be demonstrated.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">After attending this presentation, you will understand how to discover vulnerabilities in Android more effectively. Joshua will show you why this particular code is so scary, what has been done to help improve the overall security of the Android operating system, and what challenges lie ahead.</p>

Since 2005 many US municipalities have switched from a manual boot to the PayLock SmartBoot. With just a phone call and a credit card you can pay your fines and extortionate fees and fill the county coffers -- and in return they'll give you the secret code to type in and unlock the electronic vehicle immobilizer. But what if there were another way to remove the boot, quicker than a phone call and a credit card payment? Join me in a thorough reverse engineering of the PayLock SmartBoot as we disassemble one, recover and analyze the firmware from the embedded controller, and find the secrets to thoroughly pwn the device.

		<h2>Hooked Browser Meshed-Networks with WebRTC and BeEF</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Christian (@xntrik) Frichot, Principal Security Consultant at Asterisk Information Security</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">One of the biggest issues with BeEF is that each hooked browser has to talk to your BeEF server. To try and avoid detection, you often want to try and obfuscate or hide your browsers, particularly if you're heavily targeting a single organization. Don't worry Internet-friends, those crazy pioneers at Google, Mozilla and Opera have solved this problem for you with the introduction of Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC). Initially designed to allow browsers to stream multimedia to each other, the spec has made its way into most Chrome and Firefox browsers, not to mention it's enabled by default.

		</p><p class="abstract">Using this bleeding-edge web technology, we can now mesh all those hooked browsers, funnelling all your BeEF comms through a single sacrificial beach-head. Leveraging WebRTC technologies (such as STUN/TURN and even the fact the RTC-enabled browsers on local subnets can simply UDP each other), meshing browsers together can really throw a spanner into an incident-responders work. The possibilities for a browser-attacker are fairly endless, channeling comms through a single browser, or, making all the browsers communicate with each other in round-robin. This is just another tool tucked into your belt to try and initiate and maintain control over browsers.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a remote management framework that enables the collection of host information, execution of code, and provides an eventing system that can respond to operating system events in real time. FireEye has recently seen a surge in attacker use of WMI to carry out objectives such as system reconnaissance, remote code execution, persistence, lateral movement, covert data storage, and VM detection. Defenders and forensic analysts have largely remained unaware of the value of WMI due to its relative obscurity and completely undocumented file format. After extensive reverse engineering, our team has documented the WMI repository file format in detail, developed libraries to parse it, and formed a methodology for finding evil in the repository.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this talk, we will take a deep dive into the architecture of WMI, reveal a case study in attacker use of WMI in the wild, describe WMI attack mitigation strategies, show how to mine its repository for forensic artifacts, and demonstrate how to detect attacker activity in real-time by tapping into the WMI eventing system. By the end of this talk, we will have convinced the audience that WMI is a valuable asset not just for system administrators and attackers, but equally so for defenders and forensic analysts.</p>

There are many companies provide commercial GPS emulators, which can be used for the GPS spoofing, but the commercial emulators are quite expensive, or at least not free. Now we found by integrating some open source projects related to GPS we can produce GPS signal through SDR tools, e.g. USRP / bladeRF. This makes the attack cost very low. It may influence all the civilian use GPS chipset. In this presentation, the basic GPS system principle, signal structure, mathematical models of pseudo-range and Doppler effect will be introduced.

		<p class="abstract">In this talk I'll reveal new research and real attacks in the area of wirelessly controlled gates, garages, and cars. Many cars are now controlled from mobile devices over GSM, while even more can be unlocked and ignitions started from wireless keyfobs over RF. All of these are subject to attack with low-cost tools (such as RTL-SDR, GNU Radio, HackRF, Arduino, and even a Mattel toy).</p>

		<h2>Rocking the Pocket Book: Hacking Chemical Plant for Competition and Extortion</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Marina Krotofil, Senior Security Consultant. European Network for Cyber Security</p>
		<p class="speaker">Jason Larsen, Principal Security Consultant, IOActive</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The appeal of hacking a physical process is dreaming about physical damage attacks lighting up the sky in a shower of goodness. Let's face it, after such elite hacking action nobody is going to let one present it even at a conference like DEF CON. As a poor substitute, this presentation will get as close as using a simulated plant for Vinyl Acetate production for demonstrating a complete attack, from start to end, directed at persistent economic damage to a production site while avoiding attribution of production loss to a cyber-event. Such an attack scenario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors out of business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Picking up a paper these days it's easy to find an article on all the "SCADA insecurity" out there associated with an unstoppable attacker with unsophisticated goal of kicking up another apocalypse. Sorry to disappoint excited crowd but formula "Your wish is my command" does not work for control systems. The target plant is not designed in a hacker friendly way. Hopefully by the end of the presentation, the audience will understand the difference between breaking into the system and breaking the system, obtaining control and being in control. An attacker targeting a remote process is not immediately gifted with complete knowledge of the process and the means to manipulate it. In general, an attacker follows a series of stages before getting to the final attack. Designing an attack scenario is a matter of art as much as economic consideration. The cost of attack can quickly exceed damage worth. Also, the attacker has to find the way to compare between competing attack scenarios.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In traditional IT hacking, a goal is to go undetected. In OT (operational technologies) hacking this is not an option. An attack will change things in the real world that cannot be removed by simply erasing the log files. If a piece of equipment is damaged or if a plant suddenly becomes less profitable, it will be investigated. The attacker has to create forensic footprint for investigators by manipulating the process and the logs in such a way that the analysts draw the wrong conclusions.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Exploiting physical process is an exotic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to entry. Therefore real-world control system exploitation has remained in the hands of a few. To help the community mastering new skills we have developed "Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process" - first open source framework for cyber-physical experimentation based on two realistic models of chemical plants. Come to the session and take your first master class on complex physical hacking.</p>

		<p class="abstract">Over the past few years state-sponsored hacking has received attention that would make a rockstar jealous. Discussion of malware has shifted in focus from 'cyber crime' to 'cyber weapons', there have been intense public debates on attribution of various high profile attacks, and heated policy discussion surrounding regulation of offensive tools. We've also seen the sale of 'lawful intercept' malware become a global trade.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">While a substantial focus has revolved around the activities of China, Russia, and Iran, recent discoveries have revealed the capabilities of Western nations such as WARRIORPRIDE aka. Regin (FVEY) and SNOWGLOBE aka. Babar (France). Many have argued that digital operations are a logical, even desirable part of modern statecraft. The step from digital espionage to political persecution is, however, a small one. Commercially written, offensive software from companies like FinFisher and Hacking Team has been sold to repressive regimes under the guise of 'governmental intrusion' software.</p>

		<p class="abstract">Nation state hacking operations are frequently well-funded, difficult to attribute, and rarely prosecuted even if substantive evidence can be discovered. While efforts have been made to counter this problem, proof is hard to find and even more difficult to correctly interpret. This creates a perfect storm of conditions for lies, vendor lies, and flimsy attribution.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this talk we will unveil the mess happening backstage when uncovering nation state malware, lead the audience on the track of actor attribution, and cover what happens when you find other players on the hunt. We will present a novel approach to binary stylometry, which helps matching binaries of equal authorship and allows credible linking of binaries into the bigger picture of an attack. After this session the audience will have a better understanding of what happened behind the scenes when the next big APT report surfaces.</p>

		<h2>Inter-VM data exfiltration: The art of cache timing covert channel on x86 multi-core</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Etienne Martineau, Software engineer, Cisco Systems</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">On x86 multi-core covert channels between co-located Virtual Machine (VM) are real and practical thanks to the architecture that has many imperfections in the way shared resources are isolated.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This talk will demonstrate how a non-privileged application from one VM can ex-filtrate data or even establish a reverse shell into a co-located VM using a cache timing covert channel that is totally hidden from the standard access control mechanisms while being able to offer surprisingly high bps at a low error rate.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this talk you'll learn about the various concepts, techniques and challenges involve in the design of a cache timing covert channel on x86 multi-core such as:

		</p><ul>
		<li>An overview of some of the X86 shared resources and how we can use / abuse them to carry information across VMs.
		</li><li>Fundamental concept behind cache line encoding / decoding.
		</li><li>Getting around the hardware pre-fetching logic ( without disabling it from the BIOS! )
		</li><li>Data persistency and noise. What can be done?
		</li><li>Guest to host page table de-obfuscation. The easy way.
		</li><li>Phase Lock Loop and high precision inter-VM synchronization. All about timers.<p></p>
		</li></ul>

		<p class="abstract">At the end of this talk we will go over a working VM to VM reverse shell example as well as some surprising bandwidth measurement results. We will also cover the detection aspect and the potential countermeasure to defeat such a communication channel. The source code is going to be release at that time on 'github'</p>

		<h2>I Hunt Penetration Testers: More Weaknesses in Tools and Procedures</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Wesley McGrew, Assistant Research Professor Distributed Analytics and Security Institute, Mississippi State University</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">When we lack the capability to understand our tools, we operate at the mercy of those that do. Penetration testers make excellent targets for bad actors, as the average tester's awareness and understanding of the potential risks and vulnerabilities in their tools and processes is low, and the value of the information they gather and gain access to among their client base is very high. As demonstrated by Wesley's DEF CON 21 talk on vulnerabilities in penetration testing devices, and last year's compromise of WiFi Pineapple devices, the tools of offensive security professionals often represent a soft target. In this talk, operational security issues facing penetration testers will be discussed, including communication and data security (not just "bugs"), which impact both testers and clients. A classification system for illustrating the risks of various tools is presented, and vulnerabilities in specific hardware and software use cases are presented. Recommendations are made for improving penetration testing practices and training. This talk is intended to be valuable to penetration testers wanting to protect themselves and their clients, and for those who are interesting in profiling weaknesses of opposing forces that may use similar tools and techniques.</p>

		<h2>Red vs. Blue: Modern Active Directory Attacks &amp; Defense</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Sean Metcalf, CTO, DAn Solutions, Inc.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Kerberos "Golden Tickets" were unveiled by Alva "Skip" Duckwall &amp; Benjamin Delpy in 2014 during their Black Hat USA presentation. Around this time, Active Directory (AD) admins all over the world felt a great disturbance in the Force. Golden Tickets are the ultimate method for persistent, forever AD admin rights to a network since they are valid Kerberos tickets and can't be detected, right?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This talk explores the latest Active Directory attack vectors and describes how Golden Ticket usage can be detected. When forged Kerberos tickets are used in AD, there are some interesting artifacts that can be identified. Yes, despite what you may have read on the internet, there are ways to detect Golden &amp; Silver Ticket usage.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Skip the fluff and dive right into the technical detail describing the latest methods for gaining and maintaining administrative access in Active Directory, including some sneaky AD persistence methods. Also covered are traditional security measures that work (and ones that don't) as well as the mitigation strategies that disrupts the attacker's preferred game-plan. Prepare to go beyond "Pass-the-Hash" and down the rabbit hole.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Some of the topics covered:</p>

		<ul class="talkList">
		<li>Sneaky persistence methods attackers use to maintain admin rights. 
		</li><li>How attackers go from zero to (Domain) Admin
		</li><li>MS14-068: the vulnerability, the exploit, and the danger.
		</li><li>"SPN Scanning" with PowerShell to identify potential targets without network scans (SQL, Exchange, FIM, webservers, etc.).
		</li><li>Exploiting weak service account passwords as a regular AD user.
		</li><li>Mimikatz, the attacker's multi-tool.
		</li><li>Using Silver Tickets for stealthy persistence that won't be detected (until now).
		</li><li>Identifying forged Kerberos tickets (Golden &amp; Silver Tickets) on your network.
		</li><li>Detecting offensive PowerShell tools like Invoke-Mimikatz.
		</li><li>Active Directory attack mitigation.
		</li></ul>

		<p class="abstract">Kerberos expertise is not required since the presentation covers how Active Directory leverages Kerberos for authentication identifying the areas useful for attack. Information presented is useful for both Red Team &amp; Blue Team members.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Although the hacking of automobiles is a topic often discussed, details regarding successful attacks, if ever made public, are non-comprehensive at best. The ambiguous nature of automotive security leads to narratives that are polar opposites: either we're all going to die or our cars are perfectly safe. In this talk, we will show the reality of car hacking by demonstrating exactly how a remote attack works against an unaltered, factory vehicle. Starting with remote exploitation, we will show how to pivot through different pieces of the vehicle's hardware in order to be able to send messages on the CAN bus to critical electronic control units. We will conclude by showing several CAN messages that affect physical systems of the vehicle. By chaining these elements together, we will demonstrate the reality and limitations of remote car attacks.</p>

Bots, or web scrapers, can be used to gather valuable data, probe large collections of sites for vulnerabilities, exploit found weaknesses, and are often unfazed by traditional solutions like robots.txt files, Ajax loading, and even CAPTCHAs. I'll give an overview of both sides of the battle and explain what what really separates the bots from the humans. I'll also demonstrate and easy new tool that can be used to crack CAPTCHAs with high rates of success, some creative approaches to honeypots, and demonstrate how to scrape many "bot-proof" sites.</p>

		<h2>Spread Spectrum Satcom Hacking: Attacking The GlobalStar Simplex Data Service</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Colby Moore, Manager of Special Activities, Synack</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Recently there have been several highly publicized talks about satellite hacking. However, most only touch on the theoretical rather than demonstrate actual vulnerabilities and real world attack scenarios. This talk will demystify some of the technologies behind satellite communications and do what no one has done before - take the audience step-by-step from reverse engineering to exploitation of the GlobalStar simplex satcom protocol and demonstrate a full blown signals intelligence collection and spoofing capability. I will also demonstrate how an attacker might simulate critical conditions in satellite connected SCADA systems.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In recent years, Globalstar has gained popularity with the introduction of its consumer focused SPOT asset-tracking solutions. During the session, I'll deconstruct the transmitters used in these (and commercial) solutions and reveal design and implementation flaws that result in the ability to intercept, spoof, falsify, and intelligently jam communications. Due to design tradeoffs these vulnerabilities are realistically unpatchable and put millions of devices, critical infrastructure, emergency services, and high value assets at risk.</p>

<h2>Detecting Randomly Generated Strings; A Language Based Approach</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Mahdi Namazifar, Senior Data Scientist, Talos Team, Cisco Systems</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Numerous botnets employ domain generation algorithms (DGA) to dynamically generate a large number of random domain names from which a small subset is selected for their command and control. A vast majority of DGA algorithms create random sequences of characters. In this work we present a novel language-based technique for detecting strings that are generate by chaining random characters. To evaluate randomness of a given string (domain name in this context) we lookup substrings of the string in the dictionary that we've built for this technique, and then we calculate a randomness score for the string based on several different factors including length of the string, number of languages that cover the substrings, etc. This score is used for determining whether the given string is a random sequence of characters. In order to evaluate the performance of this technique, on the one hand we use 9 known DGA algorithms to create random domain names as DGA domains, and on the other hand we use domain names from the Alexa 10,000 as likely non-DGA domains. The results show that our technique is more than 99% accurate in detecting random and non-random domain names.</p>

Recent open-source hardware tools have made this field accessible to a wider range of researchers, and this presentation will show you how to perform these attacks for equipment costing $200.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Attacks against a variety of real systems will be presented: AES-256 bootloaders, internet of things devices, hardware crypto tokens, and more. All of the attacks can be replicated by the attendees, using either their own tools if such equipped (such as oscilloscopes and pulse generators), the open-hardware ChipWhisperer-Lite, or an FPGA board of their own design.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The hands-on nature of this talk is designed to introduce you to the field, and give you the confidence to pick up some online tutorials or books and work through them. Even if you've never tried hardware hacking before, the availability of open-source hardware makes it possible to follow published tutorials and learn all about side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks for yourself.</p>

		<h2>Advances in Linux Process Forensics Using ECFS</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Ryan O'Neill, Security Consultant, Leviathan Security Group</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Many hackers today are using process memory infections to maintain stealth residence inside of a compromised system. The current state of forensics tools in Linux, lack the sophistication used by the infection methods found in real world hacks. ECFS (Extended core file snapshot) technology, https://github.com/elfmaster/ecfs is an innovative extension to regular ELF core files, designed to be used as forensics-friendly snapshots of process memory. A brief showcasing of the ECFS technology was featured in POC||GTFO 0x7 (Innovations with core files).</p>
		<br>
		<p>However this talk will reveal deeper insight on the many features of this technology, such as full symbol table reconstruction, builtin detection heuristics, and how common binutils such as objdump, and readelf can be used to quickly identify complex infections such as PLT/GOT hooks and shared library injection. We will also cover the libecfs API that was created specifically for malware and forensics analysts who aim to implement support for ECFS snapshots into new or existing malware detection software.</p> 

		<p>While the ECFS core format was initially designed for runtime malware and forensics purposes, another very neat aspect to this technology was quickly extrapolated on; the ECFS snapshots can also be reloaded into memory and executed. Very similar to VM snapshots, which opens many more doors for research and exploration in a vast array of areas from dynamic analysis to migrating live processes across systems. ECFS is still a work in progress, but for those who understand the arduous nature of dissecting a process and identifying anomalies, will surely acquire a quick respect for the new technology that makes all of this so much easier.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Have you ever wanted to crack open a safe full of cash with nothing but a USB stick? Now you can!</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The Brink's CompuSafe cash management product line provides a "smart safe as a service" solution to major retailers and fast food franchises. They offer end-to-end management of your cash, transporting it safely from your storefront safe to your bank via armored car.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">During this talk, we'll uncover a major flaw in the Brink's CompuSafe and demonstrate how to crack one open in seconds flat. All you need is a USB stick and a large bag to hold all of the cash. We'll discuss how to remotely takeover the safe with full administrator privileges, and show how to enumerate a target list of other major Brink's CompuSafe customers (exposed via configuration files stored right on the safe).</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Staying Persistent in Software Defined Networks</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Gregory Pickett, Cybersecurity Operations, Hellfire Security</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The Open Network Install Environment, or ONIE, makes commodity or WhiteBox Ethernet possible. By placing a common, Linux-based, install environment onto the firmware of the switch, customers can deploy the Network Operating Systems of their choice onto the switch and do so whenever they like without replacing the hardware. The problem is, if this gets compromised, it also makes it possible for hackers to install malware onto the switch. Malware that can manipulate it and your network, and keep doing it long after a Network Operating System reinstall.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">With no secure boot, no encryption, no authentication, predictable HTTP/TFTP waterfalls, and exposed post-installation partition, ONIE is very susceptible to compromise. And with Network Operating Systems such as Switch Light, Cumulus Linux, and Mellanox-OS via their agents Indigo and eSwitchd not exactly putting up a fight with problems like no authentication, no encryption, poor encryption, and insufficient isolation, this is a real possibility.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this session, we'll cover the weaknesses in ONIE, ways to reach the platform through these Network Operating Systems, and what can happen if we don't properly protect the Control Plane these switches run on. I'll even demonstrate with a drive-by web-attack that is able to pivot through a Windows management station to reach the isolated control plane network, and infect one of these ONIE-based switches with malware, malware that's there even after a refresh. You'll even get the source code to take home with you to see how easily it's done. Finally, we'll talk about how to compensate for these issues so that your network doesn't become infected with and manipulated by this sort of persistent firmware-level malware.</p>

		<p class="speakerBio">Gregory Pickett CISSP, GCIA, GPEN has a background in intrusion analysis for Fortune 100 companies but now heads up Hellfire Security's Managed Security Services efforts and participates in their assessment practice as a network security subject matter expert.

He holds a B.S. in Psychology which is completely unrelated but interesting to know. While it does nothing to contribute to how he makes a living, it does demonstrate how screwed up he actually is.</p>

		<h2>NetRipper - Smart traffic sniffing for penetration testers</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Ionut Popescu, Senior Security Consultant at KPMG Romania</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The post-exploitation activities in a penetration test can be challenging if the tester has low-privileges on a fully patched, well configured Windows machine. This work presents a technique for helping the tester to find useful information by sniffing network traffic of the applications on the compromised machine, despite his low-privileged rights. Furthermore, the encrypted traffic is also captured before being sent to the encryption layer, thus all traffic (clear-text and encrypted) can be sniffed. The implementation of this technique is a tool called NetRipper which uses API hooking to do the actions mentioned above and which has been especially designed to be used in penetration tests, but the concept can also be used to monitor network traffic of employees or to analyze a malicious application.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Ionut works as a Senior Security Consultant at KPMG in Romania. He is passionate about ASM, reverse engineering, shellcode and exploit development and he has a MCTS Windows Internals certification.</p>

		<h2>Knocking my neighbor's kid's cruddy drone offline</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Michael Robinson, Professor, Stevenson University</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">My neighbor's kid is constantly flying his quad copter outside my windows. I see the copter has a camera and I know the little sexed crazed monster has been snooping around the neighborhood. With all of the hype around geo-fencing and drones, this got me to wondering: Would it be possible to force a commercial quad copter to land by sending a low-level pulse directly to it along the frequencies used by GPS? Of course, radio signal jamming is illegal in the U.S and, frankly, it would disrupt my electronics, too. In this presentation, we'll look at some of the research and issues we encountered, when we attempted to force land two commercial drones (the new DJI Phantom 3 and the Parrot Bepop Drone) by sending GPS signals directly at the drones (while staying under the threshold for jamming and not disrupting anyone else).</p>

		<h2>I Will Kill You</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Chris Rock, Kustodian Pty Ltd</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Have you ever wanted to kill someone? Do you want to get rid of your partner, your boss or your arch nemesis? Perhaps you want to enjoy your life insurance payout whilst you're still alive. Do you have rich elderly parents that just won't die quick enough? Or do you want a "Do Over" new identity.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Then, this presentation is for you! I'll provide you with the insight and techniques on how to "kill" someone and obtain a real death certificate and shutdown their lives. It focuses on the lack of security controls that allow any of us to virtually kill off anyone or any number of people. Forget the Dexter way of killing someone, I'll show you how to avoid the messy clean up and focusing in on the digital aspects. You could be dead right now and not even know it.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The presentation will explain the death process and will highlight the vulnerabilities and its implications world-wide.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">You will learn:</p>
		<ul class="talkList">
		<li>How to fill in a doctor's medical cause of death certificate anonymously.
		</li><li>How to become a funeral director and dispose of the body.
		</li><li>How to obtain a Death Certificate.
		</li></ul>

		<p class="abstract">Once you've wrapped your mind around that concept, I will also show you how to "birth" Virtual identities that obtain real birth certificates. You will learn the birth registration process and the security vulnerabilities associated with this as well.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The third and final step of the presentation is "The baby harvest", a concept that I've developed, which involves creating and raising virtual identities. This technique is similar to a shelf company. Virtuals will be "born", registered with the government complete with birth certificates and social security numbers. They can open up bank accounts, get a virtual job to launder money, pay taxes, obtain home loans and obtain life insurance policies. They can be married to anyone (virtual or not) and be directors of companies.... the list is endless and to complete the circle of life, they can be killed off when they are ready for "harvest" for their life insurance payouts or sold as permanent I.D.'s. With no victim, this is taking identity theft to the next level.</p>

		<p class="abstract">TrackingPoint is an Austin startup known for making precision-guided firearms. These firearms ship with a tightly integrated system coupling a rifle, an ARM-powered scope running a modified version of Linux, and a linked trigger mechanism. The scope can follow targets, calculate ballistics and drastically increase its user's first shot accuracy. The scope can also record video and audio, as well as stream video to other devices using its own wireless network and mobile applications.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this talk, we will demonstrate how the TrackingPoint long range tactical rifle works. We will discuss how we reverse engineered the scope, the firmware, and three of TrackingPoint's mobile applications. We will discuss different use cases and attack surfaces. We will also discuss the security and privacy implications of network-connected firearms.</p>

		<h2>Drinking from LETHE: New methods of exploiting and mitigating memory corruptioh2>vulnerabilities</h2>
		<br>
		<p class="speaker">Daniel Selifonov, Engineer, Skyport Systems Inc</h2>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Memory corruption vulnerabilities have plagued computer systems since we started programming software. Techniques for transforming memory corruption primitives into arbitrary code execution exploits have evolved significantly over the past two decades, from "smashing the stack for fun and profit" to the current apex of "just in time code reuse" while playing a cat and mouse game with similarly evolving defensive mitigations: from PaX/NX-bit to fine-grained ASLR and beyond. By contextualizing this battle between attack and defense, I will demonstrate new defense strategies based on augmenting fine-grained ASLR with memory disclosure mitigations to render existing exploitation techniques unreliable. Modifications to the Xen hypervisor exploiting hardware accelerated virtualization extensions on the modern Intel platform enable realizing these new defense strategies without imposing significant runtime CPU overhead.</h2>

		<h2>Breaking SSL Using Time Synchronisation Attacks</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Jose Selvi, Senior Security Consultant, NCC Group</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">What time? When? Who is first? Obviously, Time is strongly present in our daily life. We use time in almost everything we do, and computers are not an exception to this rule. Our computers and devices use time in a wide variety of ways such as cache expiration, scheduling tasks or even security technologies. Some of those technologies completely relies on the local clock, and they can be affected by a clock misconfiguration.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">However, since most operating system providers do not offer secure time synchronisation protocols by default, an attacker could manipulate those protocols and control the local clock. In this presentation, we review how different operating systems synchronise their local clocks and how an attacker could exploit some of them in order to bypass different well-known security protections.</p>

<h2>"Quantum" Classification of Malware</h2>
		<p class="speaker">John Seymour, Ph.D. student, University of Maryland, Baltimore County</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Quantum computation has recently become an important area for security research, with its applications to factoring large numbers and secure communication. In practice, only one company (D-Wave) has claimed to create a quantum computer which can solve relatively hard problems, and that claim has been met with much skepticism. Regardless of whether it is using quantum effects for computation or not, the D-Wave architecture cannot run the standard quantum algorithms, such as Grover's and Shor's. The D-Wave architecture is instead purported to be useful for machine learning and for heuristically solving NP-Complete problems.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">We'll show why the D-Wave and the machine learning problem for malware classification seem especially suited for each other. We also explain how to translate the classification problem for malicious executables into an optimization problem which a D-Wave machine can solve. Specifically, using a 512-qubit D-Wave Two processor, we show that a minimalist malware classifier, with cross-validation accuracy comparable to standard machine learning algorithms, can be created. However, even such a minimalist classifier incurs a surprising level of overhead.</p>

He's mostly interested in avoiding and helping others avoid some of the major pitfalls in machine learning, especially in dataset preparation (seriously, do people still use malware datasets from 1998?)

		<h2>Angry Hacking - the next generation of binary analysis</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Yan Shoshitaishvili, PhD Student, UC Santa Barbara</p>
		<p class="speaker">Fish Wang, PhD Student, UC Santa Barbara</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Security has gone from a curiosity to a phenomenon in the last decade. Fortunately for us, despite the rise of memory-safe, interpreted, lame languages, the security of binaries is as relevant as ever. On top of that, (computer security) Capture the Flag competitions have skyrocketed in popularity, with new and exciting binaries on offer for hacking every weekend.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This all sounds great, and it is. Unfortunately, the more time goes by, the older we get, and the more our skills fade. Whereas we were happy to stare at objdump a decade ago, today, we find the menial parts of reversing and pwning more and more tiring and more and more difficult. Worse, while security analysis tools have been evolving to make life easier for us hackers, the core tools that we use (like IDA Pro) have remained mostly stagnant. And on top of that, the term "binaries" have expanded to regularly include ARM, MIPS, PPC, MSP430, and every other crazy architecture you can think of, rather than the nice, comfortable x86 of yesteryear.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">New tools are required, and we're here to deliver. Over the last two years, we have been working on a next-generation binary analysis framework in an attempt to turn back the tide and reduce our mounting noobness. The result is called angr.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">angr assists in binary analysis by providing extremely powerful, state-of-the-art analyses, and making them as straightforward to use as possible. Ever wanted to know *what freaking value* some variable could take on in a function (say, can the target of a computed write point to the return address)? angr can tell you! Want to know what input you need to trigger a certain code path and export a flag? Ask angr! In the talk, we'll cover three of the analyses that angr provides: a powerful static analysis engine (able to, among other things, automatically identify potential memory corruption in binaries through the use of Value-Set Analysis), its symbolic execution engine, and dynamic emulation of various architectures (*super* useful for debugging shellcode).</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">On top of that, angr is designed to make the life of a hacker as easy as possible -- for example, the whole system is 98% Python, and is designed to be a breeze to interact with through iPython. Plus, it comes with a nifty GUI with nice visualizations for symbolically exploring a program, tracking differences between different program paths, and understanding value ranges of variables and registers. Finally, angr is designed to be easily extensible and embeddable in other applications. We'll show off a semantic-aware ROP gadget finder ("are there any gadgets that write to a positive offset of rax but don't clobber rbx" or "given this program state, what are the gadgets that won't cause a segfault") and a binary diffing engine, both built on angr.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">We've used angr to solve CTF binaries, analyze embedded devices, debug shellcode, and even dabble in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. We'll talk about our experiences with all of that and will release angr to the world, hopefully revolutionizing binary analysis and making everyone ANGRY!</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Yan and Fish are two members of Shellphish, a pretty badass hacking team famous for low SLA and getting the freaking exploit JUST A FREAKING MINUTE LATE. Their secret identities are those of PhD students in the security lab of UC Santa Barbara. When they're not CTFing or surfing, they're doing next-generation (what does that even mean?) security research. Their works have been published in numerous academic venues. For example, in 2013, they created an automatic tool, called MovieStealer, a tool to automatically break the DRM of streaming media services [1]. After taking 2014 to work on angr, in 2015, they followed this up with an analysis of backdoors in embedded devices [2].</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Now, they've set their sights on helping the world analyze binaries faster, better, stronger, by revolutionizing the analysis tool landscape!</p>

		<h2>High-Def Fuzzing: Exploring Vulnerabilities in HDMI-CEC</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Joshua Smith, Senior Security Researcher, HP Zero Day Initiative</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) standard has gained extensive&nbsp;market penetration. Nearly every piece of modern home theater equipment has&nbsp;HDMI support and most modern mobile devices actually have HDMI-capable outputs,&nbsp;though it may not be obvious. Lurking inside most modern HDMI-compatible&nbsp;devices is something called HDMI-CEC, or Consumer Electronics Control. This is&nbsp;the functionality that allows a media device to, for example, turn on your TV&nbsp;and change the TV's input. That doesn't sound interesting, but as we'll see in&nbsp;this presentation, there are some very surprising things an attacker can do by&nbsp;exploiting CEC software implementations. Then there's something called HEC or&nbsp;HDMI Ethernet Connection, which allows devices to establish an Ethernet&nbsp;connection of up to 100Mbit/s over their HDMI connections (newer HDMI standards&nbsp;raise the speed to 1Gbit/s).</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Don't think your mobile phone implements CEC? You might be wrong. Most modern&nbsp;Android-based phones and tablets have a Slimport(r) connection that supports
		HDMI-CEC. Ever heard of MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link)? Think Samsung and&nbsp;HTC (among other) mobile devices, and many JVC, Kenwood, Panasonic, and Sony car&nbsp;stereos - as many as 750 million devices in the world so far. Guess what? MHL&nbsp;supports HDMI-CEC as well. Let's explore, and own, this attack space.</p>

His&nbsp;focus includes analyzing and performing root-cause analysis on hundreds of&nbsp;zero-day vulnerabilities submitted by ZDI researchers from around the world. Joshua is also a developer for the Metasploit Framework and has spoken at a few&nbsp;conferences and holds a few certifications.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Prior to joining HP, Smith served in the U.S. Air Force in various roles including as an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Crew Commander and&nbsp;Instructor, but more relevantly as a penetration tester for the 92d Information&nbsp;Warfare Aggressor Squadron. Post-military, he became a security engineer at the&nbsp;John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, where he began contributing to the&nbsp;Metasploit Framework. Smith performed research into weapons systems&nbsp;vulnerabilities as well as evasion and obfuscation techniques to add depth and&nbsp;realism to security device tests. Smith received a B.S. in Aeronautical&nbsp;Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an M.A. in Management of&nbsp;Information Systems from the University of Great Falls.</p>

		<h2>Dissecting the Design of SCADA Web Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) - Hunting Vulnerabilities</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Aditya K Sood, Architect - Threat Research Labs, Elastica inc.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) are the subsets of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. HMIs are control panels that provide interfaces for humans to interact with machines and to manage operations of various types of SCADA systems. HMIs have direct access to SCADA databases including critical software programs. The majority of SCADA systems have web-based HMIs that allow the humans to control the SCADA operations remotely through Internet. This talk unveils various flavors of undisclosed vulnerabilities in web-based SCADA HMIs including but not limited to remote or local file inclusions, insecure authentication through clients, weak password hashing mechanisms, firmware discrepancies, hardcoded credentials, insecure web-services, weak cryptographic design, cross-site request forgery, and many others. This talk digs deeper into the design models of various SCADA systems to highlight security deficiencies in the existing SCADA HMI deployments. The research is driven with a motivation to secure SCADA devices and to build more intelligent solutions by hunting vulnerabilities in SCADA HMIs. The vulnerabilities presented in this talk are completely undisclosed and will be revealed for the first time with live demonstrations. </p>

		<h2>Shall We Play a Game?</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Tamas Szakaly, Lead security researcher @ PR-Audit Ltd., Hungary</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Everybody plays games, and a whole lot of people plays computer games. Despite this fact, very few of us, security researchers consider them as interesting targets. Granted, you won't likely be able to directly hack into a big corporate network via game exploits, but you could for example target the people running the company via their favorite games. Or their children's favorite games. Another scenario: you should consider that a hacked game could allow Not So Admirable people access to your internal network - which at first does not seem that big of a deal considering it's "just" a home network, but when you realize all your mobile phones, your TV set, your VOIP phones, your security cameras, and even your smart house sensors and controllers are part of that network, it looks much more scary.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Games are also interesting from a technical standpoint too, since they tend to be quite complex. The majority of them have networking, and they process complex data structures (maps, saved games, etc.) which makes them ideal fuzzing targets. But this talk is not about those kind of exploits. Hackers tend to ignore the low hanging fruits in favor of beautiful exploits, but we really shouldn't - bad guys don't care about how sophisticated some exploit is, they only care about the results. This is why I have decided to take a look around and see what's already there in the games that allows access to the gamers' network. Thus this research about how game scripting engines can be abused started.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">I'll show in this talk that playing on custom game servers and playing community created maps could easily lead to code execution on our machines - more so, in most cases without the need to bypass the operating system's exploit mitigation techniques. My targets include popular games and game engines like CryEngine 3, Dota 2, Garry's Mod, ARMA3 and Digital Combat Simulator. I'll show a wide range of script abuse from a simple direct command execution in an unrestricted scripting environment through brute forcing a security camera via HTTP requests to complex script sandbox escapes.</p>

<h2>Hacking the Human Body/brain: Identity Shift, the Shape of a New Self, and Humanity 2.0</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Richard Thieme, Author and Professional Speaker, ThiemeWorks</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This presentation is beyond fiction.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Current research in neuroscience and the extension and augmentation of senses is proceeding in directions that might sound to a twentieth century mind like science fiction. Progress is rapid but unevenly distributed: Some is directed by military, intelligence and corporate interests but beyond their concerns, we can discern the future shape of human identity itself in nascent forms.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The human body/brain is being hacked to explore radical applications for helping, healing, and harming this and future generations. Some can be done in garage-hacking style. The presenter, in fact, recently had lenses in both eyes removed and replaced with artificial ones engineered for the vision he wanted, a now-trivial surgery. The reach of new technologies promises an even more radical transformation in what it means to be human.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">One area of research is the recovery of memories, the deletion of emotional charges from memories, the removal of specific memories, the alteration of the content of memories, and the implantation of new memories. Another seeks to read the mind at a distance and extract information. Another explores the use of genomes to understand and replicate thinking, feeling, and behavior patterns. Another implements mind-to-mind communication, using neuroscience to understand brains best suited for remote viewing as well as implants and non-invasive technologies that control the electromagnetic energies of the brain to enable psychokinesis, clairvoyance and telepathy.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Augmentation of human abilities is being achieved by splicing information from sensors integrated with existing neurological channels. To feel the magnetic field of the earth, see the infrared and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, discern the yaw and pitch of airplanes, see and hear by going around our eyes and ears -- all this means we will experience the "self" in new ways.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Thieme concludes with quotes from remote viewer Joe McMoneagle, astronaut Edgar Mitchell, and his new novel FOAM to suggest the shape of the mind of the future. If you're 20 years old, you have at least a century of productive life ahead of you, so you had better be on board with the shape of your future selves. :-)</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Richard Thieme is an author and professional speaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and the future, how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges, and creativity in response to radical change and identify shift. He has explored issues raised in this DEF CON 23 presentation for 20 years but raises his game to outline the shape of the future self, defining it as a system open to modification and hacking, giving the term "biohacking" new and compelling meaning.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">His column, "Islands in the Clickstream," was distributed to subscribers in sixty countries before collection as a book in 2004. When a friend at the NSA said after they worked together on intelligence issues, "The only way you can tell the truth is through fiction," he returned to writing short stories, 19 of which are collected in "Mind Games." He is co-author of the critically extolled "UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry," a 5-year research project using material exclusively from government documents and other primary sources, now in 50 university libraries. A recently completed novel FOAM explores the existential challenges of what it means to be human in the 21st century. "The UFO History Group" is exploring a second volume and Thieme is selecting "the best of" his diverse writings for "A Richard Thieme Reader" and writing more fiction.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>From 0 To Secure In 1 Minute - Securing IAAS</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Nir Valtman, CISO - Retail, NCR </p>
		<p class="speaker">Moshe Ferber, Co-chairman of the board, Cloud Security Alliance Israel </p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Recent hacks to IaaS platforms reveled that we need to master the attack vectors used: Automation and API attack vector, insecure instances and management dashboard with wide capabilities. Those attack vectors are not unique to Cloud Computing but there are magnified due to the cloud characteristics. The fact is that IaaS instance lifecycle is accelerating, nowadays we can find servers that are installed, launched, process data and terminate - all within a range of minutes. This new accelerated lifecycle makes traditional security processes such as periodic patches, vulnerability scanning, hardening, and forensics impossible. In this accelerated lifecycle, there are no maintenance windows for patches or ability to mitigate vulnerability, so the security infrastructure must adapt to new methods. In this new thinking, we require automation of instance security configuration, hardening, monitoring, and termination. Because there are no maintenance windows, Servers must be patched before they boot up, security configuration and hardening procedures should be integrated with server installation and vulnerability scanning and mitigation processes should be automatic.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In the presentation, we plan to announce the full version of a new open source tool called "Cloudefigo" and explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demonstrate how to launch a pre-configured, already patched instance into an encrypted storage environment automatically while evaluating their security and mitigating them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live demo, we leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object storage for provisioning automated security configuration, integrating encryption, including secure encryption key repositories for secure server's communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are resilient, automatically configured, with the reduced attack surface.</p>

		<h2>Looping Surveillance Cameras through Live Editing of Network Streams</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Eric Van Albert, independent security researcher</p>
		<p class="speaker">Zach Banks, independent security researcher</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">This project consists of the hardware and software necessary to hijack wired network communications. The hardware allows an attacker to splice into live network cabling without ever breaking the physical connection. This allows the traffic on the line to be passively tapped and examined. Once the attacker has gained enough knowledge about the data being sent, the device switches to an active tap topology, where data in both directions can be modified on the fly. Through our custom implementation of the network stack, we can accurately mimic the two devices across almost all OSI layers.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">We have developed several applications for this technology. Most notable is the editing of live video streams to produce a "camera loop," that is, hijacking the feed from an Ethernet surveillance camera so that the same footage repeats over and over again. More advanced video transformations can be applied if necessary. This attack can be executed and activated with practically no interruption in service, and when deactivated, is completely transparent.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Eric is a recent MIT graduate who spends his days building 3D printers for Formlabs and his nights crawling around places he probably shouldn't. He has taught seminars on lockpicking and physical security vulnerabilities to various audiences at the Institute, and done a small bit of security consulting work. When he runs out of projects to hack on, he reads the leaked NSA ANT catalog for ideas.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Zach is also a recent MIT graduate with over 0 years of security experience. He's particularly interested in the security of embedded devices and knots. In his free time, he enjoys putting household appliances on the internet and refactoring his old code.</p>

		<h2>Pivoting Without Rights - Introducing Pivoter</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Geoff Walton, Senior Security Consultant for Cleveland-based TrustedSec</p>
		<p class="speaker">Dave Kennedy, (ReL1K/HackingDave), founder of TrustedSec and Binary Defense Systems</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">One of the most challenging steps of a penetration test is popping something and not having full administrative level rights over the system. Companies are cutting back on administrative level rights for endpoints or how about those times where you popped an external web application and were running as Apache or Network Service? Privilege escalation or pillaging systems can be difficult and require extensive time if successful at all. One of the most challenging aspects around pentesting was the need to have administrative level rights, install your tools, and from there leverage the compromised machine as a pivot point for lateral movement in the network. Well, the time has changed. Introducing Pivoter - a reverse connection transparent proxy that supports the ability to pivot with ease. Pivoter is a full transparent proxy that supports the ability to use limited rights on a system to pivot to other systems and attack transparently from your system at home. Port scans, exploits, brute forcing, anything you could do like you were on that network is now available through Pivoter. As part of this talk, we'll be releasing a new Metasploit module for shell DLL injection for AV evasion, a Linux version of Pivoter, a Windows version of Pivoter, and a PowerShell version of Pivoter. msf&gt; run pivoter -&gt; pentest as if you are on the internal network even if you don't have admin rights. Also during this talk, we'll be releasing a new major release of the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) which incorporates Pivoter into the payload delivery system.</p>

<h2>'DLL Hijacking' on OS X? #@%&amp; Yeah!</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Patrick Wardle, Director of R&amp;D, Synack</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Remember DLL hijacking on Windows? Well, turns out that OS X is fundamentally vulnerable to a similar attack (independent of the user's environment).</p>
		<br>
		<p>By abusing various 'features' and undocumented aspects of OS X's dynamic loader, this talk will reveal how attackers need only to plant specially-crafted dynamic libraries to have their malicious code automatically loaded into vulnerable applications. Through this attack, adversaries can perform a wide range of malicious actions, including stealthy persistence, process injection, security software circumvention, and even 'remote' infection. So come watch as applications fall, Gatekeeper crumbles (allowing downloaded unsigned code to execute), and 'hijacker malware' arises - capable of bypassing all top security and anti-virus products! And since "sharing is caring" leave with code and tools that can automatically uncover vulnerable binaries, generate compatible hijacker libraries, or detect if you've been hijacked.</p>

		<h2>Stick That In Your (root)Pipe &amp; Smoke It</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Patrick Wardle, Director of R&amp;D, Synack</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">You may ask; "why would Apple add an XPC service that can create setuid files anywhere on the system - and then blindly allow any local user to leverage this service?" Honestly, I have no idea!</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">The undocumented 'writeconfig' XPC service was recently uncovered by Emil Kvarnhammar, who determined its lax controls could be abused to escalate one's privileges to root. Dubbed 'rootpipe,' this bug was patched in OS X 10.10.3. End of story, right? Nope, instead things then got quite interesting. First, Apple decided to leave older versions of OS X un-patched. Then, an astute researcher discovered that the OSX/XSLCmd malware which pre-dated the disclosure, exploited this same vulnerability as a 0day! Finally, yours truly, found a simple way to side-step Apple's patch to re-exploit the core vulnerability on a fully-patched system. So come attend (but maybe leave your MacBooks at home), as we dive into the technical details XPC and the rootpipe vulnerability, explore how malware exploited this flaw, and then fully detail the process of completely bypassing Apple's patch. The talk will conclude by examining Apple's response, a second patch, that appears to squash 'rootpipe'...for now.</p>

		<h2>Confessions of a Professional Cyber Stalker</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Ken Westin, Sr. Security Analyst with Tripwire Inc.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">For several years I developed and utilized various technologies and methods to track criminals leading to at least two dozen convictions. In the process of recovering stolen devices, larger crimes would be uncovered including drugs, theft rings, stolen cars, even a violent car jacking. Much of the evidence in these cases would be collected by stolen devices themselves, such as network information, photos captured from laptops and cell phones, but often times there was additional data that would need to be gathered for a conviction. In this presentation I will walk through actual real cases and discuss in depth the technologies used and additional processes I went through utilizing open source data and other methods to target criminals. I will also discuss how these same tools and methods can be used against the innocent and steps users and developers can take to better protect privacy.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">In this presentation here are a few examples of cases I worked on which I will reveal details of:</p>

		<ul class="talkList">
		<li> How a theft ring targeting Portland, Oregon schools was unveiled leading to multiple convictions
		</li><li> How I tracked and recovered $9K worth of stolen camera equipment sold multiple times a year after it was stolen based on data extracted from images online
		</li><li> How mobile phones stolen from a wireless store were tracked leading to the arrest of a theft ring, leading to the conviction of six people and the recovery of a stolen car
		</li><li> Embedding of custom designed trojan for thermal imaging devices for theft tracking and export controls
		</li><li> Tracking of a stolen flash drive to a university computer lab and correlation of security camera and student access ID cards
		</li><li> Tracking a stolen laptop across state lines and how I gathered mountains of evidence in another theft ring case

		<h2>How to Train Your RFID Hacking Tools</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Craig Young, Security Researcher, Tripwire VERT</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">With insecure low frequency RFID access control badges still in use at businesses around the world and high frequency NFC technology being incorporated into far more consumer products, RFID hacking tools are invaluable for penetration testers and security researchers alike. Software defined radio has revolutionized this field with powerful devices like Proxmark3 and RFIDler available for a modest price. 3D printing has also presented new opportunities for makers to create custom antennas and cases to fit specific tasks. While there is a lot of great information out there about how people use these tools, there is relatively little more than source code available for learning how to develop new firmware to equip these devices with purpose-built logic. This presentation will discuss the overall architecture of the Proxmark3 and RFIDler tools and provide tutorial style examples for enhancing the firmware. Proxmark3 development will be demonstrated by upgrading the stand-alone mode to support NFC operations. For the new kid on the block, RFIDler, we will take a look at how to tweak the system for optimal reliability using 3D printing and enhanced diagnostic tools.</p>

		<h2>Security Necromancy: Further Adventures in Mainframe Hacking</h2>
		<p class="speaker">Philip Young, aka Soldier of Fortran, Chief Mainframe Hacker</p>
		<p class="speaker">Chad "Bigendian Smalls" Rikansrud, President of Mainframe Hacking</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">You thought they were dead didn't you? You thought "I haven't seen a mainframe since the 90s, no one uses those anymore." Well you're wrong. Dead wrong. If you flew or drove to DEF CON your information was hitting a mainframe. Did you use credit or cash at the hotel? Doesn't matter, still a mainframe. Did you pay taxes, or perhaps call 911? What about going to the doctor? All using mainframes. At multiple points throughout the day, even if you don't do anything, your data is going through some mainframe, somewhere. 1984? Yeah right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' large. So why is no one talking about them?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">SoF &amp; Bigendian Smalls, aka 'the insane chown posse', will dazzle and amaze with feats of hackery never before seen on the mainframe. From fully breaking network job entry (NJE) and their concept of trusted nodes, to showing you what happens when you design security in the 80s and never update your frameworks. We'll demonstrate that, yes Charlie Brown, you can in fact overflow a buffer on the mainframe. New tools will be released! Things like SET'n'3270 (SET, but for mainframes!) and VTAM walker (profiling VTAM applications). Updates to current tools will be released (nmap script galore!) everything from accurate version profiling to application ID brute forcing and beyond. You'll also learn how to navigate IBM so you can get access to your very own mainframe and help continue the research that we've started!</p>
		<br>
		<p class="abstract">All of your paychecks rely on mainframes in one form or another, so maybe we should be talking about it.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Soldier of Fortran:
		Protect ya REXX! Soldier of Fortran has an unhealthy relationship with mainframes. Being a hacker from way back in the day (BBS and X.25 networks) he was always enamored by the idea of hacking mainframes. Always too expensive and mysterious he settled on hacking windows and linux machines. However, despite not having his own he conducted numerous security engagements against mainframes, slowly developing his skills, until 2010 when he finally got his very own. Not having to worry about system uptime or affecting users he dove in head first and was surprised by what he found. Ever since he has been telling anyone who will listen to him the importance of mainframe security, hacking and research. He's spoken both domestically and internationally on the topic, been a guest speaker at multiple conferences, developed tools for mainframe penetration testing and has even keynoted at large mainframe conferences about this topic.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="speakerBio">Bigendian Smalls:
		BS ain't no chump, takin' apart everything as a child just to see how it works invariable led him to security. From BBSin' back in the day to placing second in the network forensics challenge last year he knows what he's doing. At work and at home he does vulnerability research, forensics and disassembly of all things both on hardware and software. Knowing no system is secure and seeing how closed the source, community and information around the mainframe is he got worried. Worried that the code was as secure as they said it was. Worried that because no one is looking, developers are getting away with murder. Sure, IBM says they got their shit together, but then again so does Oracle, CISCO, Fireeye etc . Having worked on mainframes for more than a decade he knows how frustrating this is. With books from the 80s and forum posts from the 90s being of very little value, he aims to help drive the future of mainframe security research.</p>

Through this way, manufactories can offer remote service and develop a lot of attractive functions to make their product more valuable. However, many vulnerabilities have also been introduced into these systems.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="abstract">Some existing solutions, such as USRP based OpenBTS, commercial product nanoBTS can be used to build a fake base station and capture data traffic. However all of them cannot access the real operator's core network so that they cannot capture real SMS and voice traffic.</p>

		<p class="abstract">With the inspiration from social engineering, we got a femto-cell base station from a telecom operator. After a series of hacking and modifications, we built it as a powerful SMS, voice and data link inception tool. Furthermore, not like a fake station, it's a legal base station and authorized to access the operator's core network. By this tool, we can conveniently explore vulnerabilities of cellular modem inside products.</p>
