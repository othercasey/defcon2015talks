HTML, PDF versions of the talks at 2015 DefCon #23

Content taken directly from https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-speakers.html on 29 July 2015, and edited here for personal use. I've removed unhappy character encodings, and reformatted things for consistency. If I've missed any, I'm very sorry and please let me know about them / fix it yourself. I've left all the links and content as-is, so any other errors or misspellings are courtesy the speaker who submitted them & the Def Con editorial board or whoever. 1 2 3 not it.

**defcon.html** is a barebones, web-friendly copy of the speaker-generated talk information.

**defcon-docformatting.html** is a document copy-pasting friendly copy, but looks like crap online.

**defcon.css** is a very lightweight CSS file that makes the HTML files look pretty.

**DefCon23TalksPresentations-93pgPDF.pdf** is a (you may have guessed) 93-page PDF version of defcon-docformatting.html. I would not recommend printing this one unless you hate trees, but maybe send a copy to your Kindle?
